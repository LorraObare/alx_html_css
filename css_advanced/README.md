Welcome to this series of learning Advanced HTML with Alx Frontend Program.
At the start of the project, I created a basic HTML structure with completely no css to style it.
The learning area is to understand how to place and position the content of a webpage even before styling it.

The HTML structure consists of blocks, <head>, <body> and <footer>
Inside the body of the website, there are different sections containing content and organized in container-like manner.
