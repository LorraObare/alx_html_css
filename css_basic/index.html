      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I come from Nairobi, Kenya. I was born and raised in Kisumu and initially dreamed of becoming a doctor. 
        However, life had different plans and I found myself exploring the world of technology. 
        At first, it was confusing and overwhelming, but soon everything started to click. 
        My passion for tech grew, and with it, my confidence, courage, and purpose. 
        Today, Iâ€™m a software developer in the making, excited to see where this journey leads me.
